Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)*\n",

    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because it reduces the size of the training images from (32,32,3) to (32,32,1), thus decreasing the amount of time it takes to train the model. Most importantly though, it takes away distoritons caused by color. For example, color saturation at night or in low light might differ substantially from direct sunlight. Grayscale can help to reduce errors. I used a simple average for grayscaling the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the image after grayscaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4a]\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I histogram equalized the image from grayscale. I used the built in cv2.equalizeHist() function. I did this to account for inequal images. As visible in the image, it corrects the brightness visibly:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last step, I normalized the image data. As you can see this doesn't change the image visually. However, it does add to the training process of the net, since values are normalized and not on a scale of 0 - 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",

    "I've experimented with adding additional data. I used two techniques for augemntation: \n",

    "*4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.*\n",

    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 100%\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 97.4%\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 94.7%\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a combination of well known structure and iterative approach. My architecture is based on the LeNet-5 architecture. This architecture has proven to work well on image data of similar size. Traffic signs have similar features to handwritten numbers, which can be learned by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize, I added a dropout of 0.5 to both fully connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can see the training process:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards the end of the 100 epochs (which may have been a bit overkill) we see a training accuracy of 100% and a steady validation accuracy of 95% - 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate tha data, a function was created. It can be found in cell 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach I used was the standard LeNet-5 architecture with all provided training data without using grayscale. I adapted the architecture to accomodate the image shape of (32,32,3) for color images. After that I stared with grayscaling, added histogram equalization and normalizdation later on. I added additional pooling layers and adapted the sizes, but saw a drop in accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "I haven't experienced overfitting. After experimenting with the architecture I turned towards the number of epochs and the batch size. Increasing the number of epochs generllay led to better results. Decreasing the batch size was my final adjustment, which helped to increase the model accuracy. I did this after reading acrticles about optimal batchsizes. Gernerally, lower batchsizes lead to more iterations and better tuning of the model parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final accuracy show evidence that the adaptation of the LeNet-5 architecture is a good approach to robust traffic sign classification.\n",

Options vary from using 2 models and averaging predictions or using the shape to pre-classify the image.
